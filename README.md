# Days-of-D3
Are you amazed by all those amazing scatterplots or histograms, D3 is the first thing you should learn. 

### D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.
#### When combined with svg it has the power to create amazing data visuals. 
As you can see below:-

I am attaching some of my favourite files and how amazing they look is shown at the starting of the file as well.
This repo contains a scatterplot, a histogram,  pie-chart, a count-the-letters game and a guess the password game using 
D3 dom-manipulation.

*(The data sets used for the plots are attached with the particular folder).*

In addition to that, there are various websites where you can see the magic of D3 in action, the links are attached below.
